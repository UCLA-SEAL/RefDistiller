Refactoring Inspection Support for Manual Refactoring Edits (TSE 2017)
https://sites.google.com/site/refdistiller/


## Summary

Manual refactoring edits are error prone, as refactoring requires developers to coordinate related transformations and understand the complex inter-relationship between affected files, variables, and methods. We propose RefDistiller, an approach for improving detection of manual refactoring anomalies by two combined strategies. First, it uses a predefined template to identify potential missed refactoring edits---omission anomalies. Second, it leverages an automated refactoring engine to separate behavior-preserving edits from behavior-modifying edits---commission anomalies. We evaluate its effectiveness on a data set with one hundred manual refactoring bugs. These bugs are hard to detect because they do not produce any compilation errors nor are caught by the pre- and post-condition checking of many existing refactoring engines. RefDistiller is able to identify 97% of the erroneous edits, of which 24% are not detected by the given test suites.
